# Leather Engine - Mania Plus

This is a small modification of Leather Engine that adds a "Custom Key Amount" option, which lets you convert and play any song to any supported key amount (1K to 21K). Also includes some minor bugfixes.

The source code is based on Leather Engine v0.4.2 and uses the same library versions, so it should be compatible with the latest mods.

## How to use

The custom key amount option can be found in the "Misc" section in the options menu.
